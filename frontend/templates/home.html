        <h2>Understanding 5/3/1</h2>
        <p>
            5/3/1 is a strength training program designed to build strength progressively.
            The program works by using a percentage of your 1-rep max (1RM) for each lift, known as your "training max."
            Your training max is calculated as 90% of your 1RM. Each week, you perform sets based on a percentage of this training max.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing a four-week cycle, you can increase your training max by 5 lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, overhead press) 
            and by 10 lbs for lower body lifts (squat, deadlift) before starting the next cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> You should first know your 1-rep max (1RM) for each lift. 
            If you don't know your 1RMs, you'll need to determine them first before entering the values into the app.
